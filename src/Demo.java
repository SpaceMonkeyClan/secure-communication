 /**
 * The requirements of the system include:
 *
 * 1.) The two parties have each other’s RSA public key. Each of them holds his/her own RSA private key.
 *
 * 2.) Each party’s message (from a .txt file) is encrypted using AES before sending it to another party.
 *
 * 3.) The AES key used in 2) is encrypted using the receiver’s RSA public key. The encrypted AES key is sent together
 *      with the encrypted message obtained from 2).
 *
 * 4.) Message authentication code should be appended to data transmitted. You are free to choose the specific protocol
 *      of MAC.
 *
 * 5.) The receiver should be able to successfully authenticate, decrypt the message, and read the original message.
 *
 * You need to implement a program for each role (i.e., sender and receiver). You don’t need to include actual socket
 * programming in your code. You can just use local files to simulate the communication in the network. For example,
 * to implement requirement 1 above, we let each party locally generate a key pair and save each key in a corresponding
 * file. The other party will be able to know the public key by accessing the file. You can create a file called
 * “Transmitted_Data”, which can include all data transmitted between sender and receiver, i.e., encrypted message,
 * encrypted AES key, and the MAC. This file is written by the sender and read by the receiver.
